<h1> Vetinary Surgery Application </h1>

<h2> The Breif </h2>

This was the first solo project during the course at CodeClan. Our brief was to create a application that had RESTFUL routes
and had full CRUD capabilities. 
 
We had to code the project in Ruby using Sinatra as it's light framework and Postgres SQL as the database.
